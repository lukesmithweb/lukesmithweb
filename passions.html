			<h2>My Passions</h2>

			<h3>I have many passions in many different areas. I am continuously discovering new hobbies or areas that spike my curiosity and I would love to share them with other people! If you find something interesting and you would like to connect, reach out to me via LinkedIn. </h3>

			<h2>Computer-Aided Design</h2>


				<h3>Autodesk Fusion 360</h3><p>I was introduced to Fusion 360 in 2018 while being a teacher's assistant in my engineering technology class in high school. To this day, I continue to fine tune my skills in the program and learn new functions when time permits. Within Fusion 360, I have focused on modeling 3D objects such as boats and building framing.</p>

				<h3>Rhinoceros 3D</h3><p>Rhinoceros 3D is where my passion for 3D computer-aided design began. I was able to start learning Rhinoceros 3D in a middle school elective course in 2015. During my time in highschool, I was a teacher's assistant in which I helped teach students to use Rhinoceros 3D and troubleshoot errors. I continued to use Rhinoceros 3D until I graduated high school in 2020. Within this program I have designed many small 3D models to be 3D printed such as ducks, name plates, and chess pieces. I have also used the 2D design capabilities to use with wood CNC machines, wood laser cutters, and metal plasma cutters.</p>

			<h2>Writing Code</h2>

				<h3>Website Design</h3><p>This website has been a great opportunity for me to remember the skills I learned in JavaScript as well as learn HTML and CSS. I have found that the practical implementation of such skills (although I am still a beginner) is very rewarding and helps me to understand how other websites operate. I will continue to develop these skills and hope to be able to help others with them as well.</p>

				<h3>AP Computer Science Principles</h3><p>My introduction into the world of coding began by taking the Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles course offered at my highschool. The course is an introductory college level course that introduces many concepts in computer science and places a focus on JavaScript. Through this course I was able to learn the basics of JavaScript and computer science, see how local technology businesses operated, and start thinking from a different perspective.</p>

				<h3>Video Game Design</h3><p>After my introduction into computer science from my AP Computer Science Principles course, I elected to take the Video Game Design course. Unlike the AP course, Video Game design did not use JavaScript and was much more entry level. I found I really liked the basic concepts and designing games, however, some of the complexity I was used to was severely missed.</p>


			<h2>Marketing</h2>

				<h3>University of Ljubljana</h3><p>My university journey began without me knowing exactly what I wanted to choose in terms of my major. As I took classes I rediscovered a love for marketing that I had found before in high school. I continue to be fascinated by the topics I learn in marketing focused classes and would love to put them to the test in the future.</p>

				<h3>Marketing in High School</h3><p>I took a marketing class in high school which was the first time I had even thought of marketing as a career path. I became fascinated with the idea that you can change peoples' perspectives of a product or a company solely based on the marketing. Following this beginner course, I was also able to run marketing campaigns for our high school student store.</p>	




			<h2>Financial Planning</h2>

				<h3>Investing</h3><p>As I began navigating the world of investments, I quickly realized the importance of being knowledgeable and making informed decisions with my money. Through my own investment experiences, I have learned valuable lessons from both successful ventures and occasional setbacks. These experiences sparked my curiosity and ignited a passion for understanding the intricacies of finance.</p>

				<h3>Amplified Planning Externship</h3><p>As a participant in the Externship lead by Amplified Planning, I had the opportunity to observe professionals in action and gain exposure to the complexity of financial planning. Through this experience, I was able to ask questions about topics that interested me as well as learn from professionals with diverse backgrounds and experiences in many forms of financial planning. The Externship reinforced my belief in the importance of financial planning as a tool for long-term success.</p>
